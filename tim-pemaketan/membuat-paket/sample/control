# Don't forget to comply with Debian policy regarding package names
# libpackageX : package contains library with SONAME X
#               SONAME is shared object version number
#               The number can be obtained by doing
#               readelf -a libname.so.x.x.x | grep SONAME
#               if the package name already contains number
#               then append a dash before soname
#               e.g. libdbus-glib-1-2 (libdbus-glib-1 is the name, 2 is SONAME)
# libpackage-dev: package contains development files for libpackageX
#                 also don't forget hard dependency to libpackageX
# libpackageX-dbg: package contains debugging files for libpackageX
# package: package contains binaries
# package-dbg: package contains debugging files for package
# python-package: package contains python scripts
